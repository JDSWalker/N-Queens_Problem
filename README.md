#### Basic Program Overview  
The _n_-queens problem is a generalization of the [8-queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) for placing 8 non-attacking queens on a regular chess board. The _n_-queens problem asks, given a positive integer _n_,  how many ways are there to place _n_ chess queens on an _n_x_n_ chess board such that none of the queens can attack each other.  

#### Required Tools for 8-Queens Solver in C:  
- [gcc version 5.4](gcc.gnu.org/)  or newer  

#### C Program Compilation and Execution:  
<pre>$ gcc eight_queens_solver.c -o eight_queens_solver  
$ ./eight_queens_solver.exe</pre>  

#### Required Tools for _n_-Queens Solver in R:  
- [R version 3.0](www.r-project.org/) or newer  

#### Algorithm Details  
The algorithm implemented to solve the n-queens problem was obtained online from the bottom of the webpage for [A Short Introduction to the Art of Programming](www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD316.9.html) by [Dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra). The algorithm shown below has been adapted and reformatted from the one provided in the link above.

      k := k + 1
