#### Basic Program Overview  
The n-queens problem is a generalization of the [8-queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) which asks how many ways are there to place n chess queens on an n x n chess board such that none of the queens can attack each other.  

#### Required Tools for 8-Queens Solver in C:  
- gcc   

#### Compilation and Program Execution:  
<pre>$ gcc eight_queens_solver.c -o eight_queens_solver  
$ ./eight_queens_solver.exe</pre>  

#### Algorithm Details  
The algorithm implemented to solve the n-queens problem was obtained online from the bottom of the webpage for [A Short Introduction to the Art of Programming](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD316.9.html) by [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra).
