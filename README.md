#### Basic Program Overview  
The _n_-queens problem is a generalization of the [8-queens puzzle](wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) involving how to place eight non-attacking queens on a regular [chess board](wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard). The _n_-queens problem asks, given a positive integer _n_,  how many ways are there to place _n_ chess queens on an _n_ x _n_ chess board such that none of the queens can attack each other.  

#### 8-Queens Solver in C  
**Required Tools:**  
- [gcc version 5.4](gcc.gnu.org/) or newer  

**Example of Program Compilation, Execution and Partial Output:**  
<pre>$ gcc eight_queens_solver.c -o eight_queens_solver  
$ ./eight_queens_solver.exe  
1 5 8 6 3 7 2 4  
1 6 8 3 7 4 2 5  
...  
...  
8 3 1 6 2 5 7 4

#### _n_-Queens Solver in R:  
**Required Tools:**  
- [R version 3.0](www.r-project.org/) or newer  

**Examples of Program Execution:**  
<pre>> # Outputting solutions to the 4-queens problem standard out  
> SolveNQueens(4)  
The solver found 2 solutions for the 4-Queens problem:  
Solution 1:     2 4 1 3  
Solution 2:     3 1 4 2

#### Algorithm Details  
The algorithm implemented to solve the _n_-queens problem was obtained online from the bottom of the webpage for [A Short Introduction to the Art of Programming](www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD316.9.html) by [Dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra). The algorithm shown below has been adapted and reformatted from the one provided in the link above.
