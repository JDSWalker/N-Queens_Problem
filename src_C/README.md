## 8-Queens Solver in C  
Following the constrained DFS algorithm, a solver for the 8-queens problem was implemented using the C programming language. When executed, the 8-Queens Solver outputs all of the valid solutions for the 8-queens problem. Each solution will consist of 8 integers corresponding to the columns from A to H on the chess board, with each integer representing the row of the queen in the given column. In the example shown below, the numbers in the 8-queens solution `1 5 8 6 3 7 2 4` correspond to queen positions at `A1`, `B5`, `C8`, `D6`, `E3`, `F7`, `G2`, and `H4` on the chess board.
