## _n_-Queens Solvers Implemented in the C Programming Language  
Using the constrained DFS algorithm, a solver for the 8-queens problem was implemented using the C programming language. Following this, the 8-Queens Solver was used as a template to generalize the algorithm and write the _n_-Queens Solver, first in the R programming language, and later in the C programming language as well.  

When executed, the 8-Queens Solver outputs all of the valid solutions for the 8-queens problem. Each solution will consist of 8 integers corresponding to the columns from A to H on the chess board, with each integer representing the row of the queen in the given column. In the example shown below, the numbers in the 8-queens solution `1 5 8 6 3 7 2 4` correspond to queen positions at `A1`, `B5`, `C8`, `D6`, `E3`, `F7`, `G2`, and `H4` on the chess board.

While the 8-Queens Solver does not use dynamic allocation for any variables, the _n_-Queens Solver dynamically allocates a chess board struct containing multiple dynamically allocated integer arrays which enables it to solve _n_-queens problems using different values of _n_. The _n_-Queens Solver outputs the same style of output, but will do so far any positive integer value of _n_ passed into the program. If no value is passed, the program defaults to solving the 4-queens problem. Examples of both behaviours are provided below.
